HTRC UnCamp XXXX: Code of Conduct

HTRC UnCamp seeks to provide a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion. This yearâ€™s inclusivity chair is J. Stephen Downie who is responsible for encouraging diversity and inclusion for all UnCamp participants.
 
The conference organizers will not tolerate harassment and other exclusionary behavior in any form. This includes, but is not limited to:
Violent threats or language directed against another person.

Discriminatory jokes and language.

Posting sexually explicit or violent material.

Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").

Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.

Unwelcome sexual attention.

Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.
 
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Attendees who disregard these guidelines may be asked to leave the conference, without a refund, at the discretion of the conference organizers. Anyone who experiences harassment or feels unsafe is encouraged to contact the UnCamp Inclusivity Chair and UnCamp General Co-Chairs at <co-chairs email contact>, or to contact the Inclusivity Chair, <name of chair for XXXX> in person or by phone <xxx-xxx-xxxx>. All reports will be treated confidentially.
